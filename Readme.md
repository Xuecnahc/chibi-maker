# Goal
Create a chibi character... As we are doing it for role play games and need to add more elements it is great to our own version.

# Set Up
- To run this server you obviously need node.js to be installed
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run serve`
- Hit the url `localhost:3000` on your favorite modern web broswer
